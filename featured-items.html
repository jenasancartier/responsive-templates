        Every day is taco ipsum tuesday. Shrimp tacos are tasty tacos! It’s taco time all the time. Yeah, apparently the taco shack was robbed. They left the money but took the tacos. Pico de gallo, on the side please. Side of rice and beans, please. You see, the refried beans are really just the adhesive necessary to apply the soft tortilla to the hard taco shell. Burritos are very tasty. It’s long been rumored that the chupacabra is really just a crazed man who’s local taco shop went out of business.
